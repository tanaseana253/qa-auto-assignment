Oracle QA Automation Assignment



This repository contains the solution to the QA automation assignment- Algorithm challenge 2:

- Write a function that takes as arguments a string and a number and returns all unique contiguous substrings of length num that have num-1 distinct chars. We should return an empty list if no substrings can be found.



Run Instructions:

- open algorithm_challenge_2.html



Assignment considerations:

- functions use 
- It is not case sensitive, meaning the same lowesr case and upper case character is considered the same character.
- I used Bootstrap for the frontend.
- I implemented validation for blank text, text composed just of spaces and ignores spaces in the text.
